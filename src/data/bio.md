## Machine Learning Engineer | Senior SW Consultant

### PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY  
Certified Machine Learning Engineer and Senior Software Consultant with 10+ years of experience in Full-Stack development and cloud-native infrastructures. I combine deep expertise in scalable backend systems (Python, Java, Go, Node.js, TypeScript) with advanced knowledge in MLOps, RAG architectures, and Computer Vision. With a proven track record in automating complex development lifecycles, I am now focused on deploying high-performance AI models and robust data pipelines.


### WORK EXPERIENCE  
Professional Sabbatical & AI Transformation  
Liora, Sorbonne University Paris | 2024.10 - 2026.04  
- Spearheaded Deep Learning & CV projects: Architected and trained high-precision Object Detection and Classification models using PyTorch and TensorFlow/Keras.
- Engineered a Hybrid Recommendation System: Drove the entire data lifecycle from complex preprocessing to advanced feature engineering.
- Optimized Model Performance: Conducted rigorous evaluations using Precision-Recall and F1-Score; implemented visualization tools to track and improve training dynamics.
- Architected MLOps & GenAI Pipelines: Deployed scalable RAG systems and Agentic AI (LangChain) workflows, integrating MLFlow, ZenML, and Vector Databases for production readiness.

Senior Software Consultant  
Geek In Business Karlshuld, Germany | 2021.09 - 2025.09  
- Platform Engineering (Go/Backstage.io): Engineered self-service bootstrapping tool using Go and GitHub Actions to automate standardized microservice generation, eliminating manual infrastructure setup and standardizing CI/CD provisioning (K8s/Tekton).
- Legacy Modernization & Cloud-Native Fullstack Development: Implemented a Costume Rental Management system and manufacturing order processing system as well as creating frontends using Vue.js, JakartaEE (Quarkus), complete replacement of a legacy system with a new platform into a modern and scalable Docker/Linux environment.
- Data & Legacy Migration: Led a database migration from PostgreSQL to SQL Server and refactored core Product Information Systems, achieving measurable gains in data processing speed and reducing operational costs for data managers.
- Observability & Data Visualization: Developed custom Backstage.io plugins (React/Node.js) to automate Scrum reporting and interactive Technology Radars (D3.js), centralizing data from Jira, Prometheus, and NexusIQ to enhance cross-team transparency and reducing manual reporting effort for stakeholders.
